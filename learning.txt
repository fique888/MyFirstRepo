Something Iâ€™ve Learned So Far in This Course

So far in the Foundation of Linux course, I have learned how to use Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration. I now understand how to fork a repository, make changes, commit them with a clear message, and create a pull request to contribute to a project. This has helped me see how developers work together on open-source projects and manage their code efficiently. I also learned basic Linux commands, which allow me to navigate the terminal and manage files effectively.
